# rxTracker

We wanted to take some time to actually try coding our main dashboard. However, we did not have enough time for full implementation as our app is too complete to implement in 48 hrs. Therefore, we decided to have fun with RShiny to create at least a static version of our application.

As we rely on data from healthwatch/third party applications, our Rshiny app depends on static data. We successfully mocked a simple login system, estimated time count down and basic UI elements.

We plan to fully implement rxTracker with a more suitable tech stack such as react, node, javascript and a database (sql or mongo).
